## Description

[link to walkthough]

This is a software engineering team generator command line application. Using the Terminal/PowerShell/GitBash/... the user will enter all relevant information to their team, and generate an HTML page for them.

The goal of this assignment is to focus on *how* we, as coders, design our code. Keeping code organized and accessible to future programers is very important. Test driven programming is also a focus here, though the tests have already been written.

## Installation

For this engine, you will to use Terminal (if you are on Mac) or PowerShell (if you are on Windows) both of these are already installed. Node.js is required. You will need to git clone (download) this repository. npm install will give you everything else you need (Express and Inquirer).
